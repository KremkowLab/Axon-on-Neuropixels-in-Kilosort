To visualize the axons, replace the original ´make_fig.m´ located in the kilosort main folder (´KS-master/mainLoop´) with this Matlab script.

Our modified version of this script will organize the plotting of the waveforms according to the peak value of their rebound:
- We illustrate the different waveforms in the first subplot of KS (´Temporal Components´) from the biggest (left) to the smallest (right) rebounds.
- In the second plot from the top right (not named), we illustrate only the 10 waveforms with the largest rebounds, i.e. the first 10 waveforms on the left of the ´Temporal Components´ subplot.
